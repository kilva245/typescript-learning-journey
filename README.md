# üöÄ TypeScript Learning Journey & Practice Repo

**Welcome!**

This repository serves as a dedicated space to document my learning process, store exercises, and develop small projects while mastering **TypeScript (TS)**. My focus is on deeply understanding the Type System and applying TS practically in various contexts.

## üìö Repository Structure and Content

Projects and exercises are primarily structured based on the core resources I am currently using:

| Folder | Content | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`aparat-course-exercises`** | **Hands-on practice and code associated with the main Aparat course.** | ‚úÖ **In Progress** |

### **Primary Learning Resource**

The exercises in the dedicated folder are based on the following free educational course:

* **Course Name:** Free TypeScript Tutorial (ÿ¢ŸÖŸàÿ≤ÿ¥ ÿ±ÿß€å⁄ØÿßŸÜ TypeScript)
* **Platform:** Aparat
* **Link:** [https://www.aparat.com/v/amkr6uk?playlist=14560773](https://www.aparat.com/v/amkr6uk?playlist=14560773)

## üí° Key Concepts Learned So Far

As I progress, the key foundational concepts and practical steps I have focused on and successfully executed include:

* **TypeScript Fundamentals:**
    * Understanding the basic definition, its purpose, and the concept of **static typing** versus JavaScript's dynamic typing.
    * Recognizing the core benefits of using TS (**scalability**, better tooling, catching errors early).
* **Environment Setup & Compilation:**
    * Successfully installing the **TypeScript compiler** globally using `npm install -g typescript`.
    * Understanding the use of `tsc --init` to create a **`tsconfig.json`** file.
    * Creating an `index.ts` file, writing a typed variable (`let message: string = '...'`), and successfully **compiling** it to `index.js` using the command `tsc index.ts`.
* **Core Data Types and Type System:**
    * **Primitive Types**: Mastery of declaring and using **`string`**, **`number`**, and **`boolean`** types.
    * **Type Safety**: Understanding how TS prevents assigning an incorrect value type to a declared variable at compile time.
    * **Arrays and Tuples**:
        * Learning to define type-safe **Arrays** (e.g., `number[]` or `Array<string>`).
        * Mastering **Tuples** for fixed-length arrays with specific type order (e.g., `[string, number]`).
    * **Object Structure Typing**: Defining the precise shape of **Objects** by specifying the **type** for each property (e.g., `{name: string, age: number}`).
    * **The `any` Type and Inference**:
        * Understanding the purpose and the strong recommendation to avoid the **`any`** type.
        * Grasping **Type Inference**, where TS automatically assigns a type based on the initial value.
