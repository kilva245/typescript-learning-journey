## 💡 Key Concepts Learned So Far

As I progress, the key foundational concepts and practical steps I have focused on and successfully executed include:

-   **TypeScript Fundamentals:** Understanding the basic definition, its purpose, and the concept of static typing versus JavaScript's dynamic typing.
-   **Reasons for Adoption:** Recognizing the core benefits of using TS (scalability, better tooling, catching errors early).
-   **Environment Setup:** Successfully installing the **TypeScript compiler** globally using `npm install -g typescript`.
-   **Compiler Initialization:** Understanding the use of `tsc --init` to create a `tsconfig.json` file, and verifying installation with `tsc -v`.
-   **First TS File Execution:** Creating an `index.ts` file, writing a typed variable (`let message: string = '...'`), and successfully compiling it to `index.js` using the command `tsc index.ts` for browser execution.
